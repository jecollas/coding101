            <strong>!DOCTYPE html</strong> is the tag at the top of a document that declares the document type and the language we're using (html: hypertext markup language).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>html</strong> is the tag that wraps around the entirety of the document. <strong>Lang</strong> defines the language we are using (en-us: English, United States), and <strong>dir</strong> defines which direction the text should be read from (ltr: left to right).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>head</strong> is the tag that contains the document's title, meta data, and links that need to be loaded at the beginning of the document. This is where you would link any appropriate stylesheets.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>title</strong> is the tag that declares the title of the document in which you're working. When viewing the document in a browser, it shows up as the name of tab.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>meta charset</strong> is the meta tag that declares the appropriate character set for the document to draw upon. Currently the most popular charset is utf-8 (utf: unicode transformation format). This matters for unicode and HTML codes, which can be used in place of characters not commonly found on keyboards. Examples of these can be found <a href="https://unicode-table.com/en/#basic-latin" target="_blank">here</a>. More information about what utf-8 is and how it's different from other unicode transformational formats can be found <a href="http://www.unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>viewport</strong> is the meta tag that tells your computer how the window should be viewed. <strong>width=device-width</strong> and <strong>initial-scale=1</strong> both say that the width of the web page should be the width of the device currently hosting that page. This allows you to resize the browser window and makes your website more <em>responsive.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>body</strong> is the tag that contains the body of your webpage. This is where the meat of the content is. This is everything that you will see on the page.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>header</strong> is the tag that hosts content that lives at the top of your page. This is where you would put your page's title and navigation (if you have one).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>h1</strong> is one of six tags used for titles, h1 being the biggest and h6 being the smallest. They're header tags in that they're used as headers within the content of your document.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h1>h1</h1>
            <h2>h2</h2>
            <h3>h3</h3>
            <h4>h4</h4>
            <h5>h5</h5>
            <h6>h6</h6>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>p</strong> is your paragraph tag. Every time you need to start a new paragraph, p is the tag you would use.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>div</strong> is a container tag. It can be used to group sections of your code. Another example of a container tag is <strong>span</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>br</strong> is a tag for breaks in your text. It is usually used in between paragraph tags, and is unique in that it doesn't require a closing tag.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>b</strong> and <strong>strong</strong> are both tags used to make text bold. The difference between the two is that screen readers will pronounce words within strong tags with extra emphasis, while words within b tags won't be. In the case of a piece of text, bolded words (such as titles) would use the b tag, while bolded words within the text itself (such as those used in dialogue) would use the strong tag.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>i</strong> and <strong>em</strong> are both tags used to make text appear in italics. The difference between the two is that screen readers will pronounce words within em tags with extra emphasis, while words within i tags won't be. Again, in the case of a piece of text, italicized words (such as titles) would use the i tag, while italicized words in dialogue would use the em tag. It all depends on whether or not the italicization is used for the sake of verbal emphasis or not.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>u</strong> is the tag used for underlining things. One thing to note here is that underlined pieces of text can be confused for links, so use these sparingly.
        </p>
