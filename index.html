    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

    <p>This is how you make text <b>bold.</b> It can also be done like <strong>this,</strong> to let the computer know that the text has a strong importance!</p>

    <p>This is how to make text in <i>italics.</i> You can also do it <em>this way,</em> to denote an <em>emphasis.</em> Screen readers will pronounce words in this tag with an emphasis.</p>

    <p><small>This is small text.</small></p>

    <p><big>This is big text.</big></p>

    <p>This is a <s>strike.</s></p>

    <p>This is an <u>underline</u>.</p>

    <p>If you want to write text where something is <del>deleted</del> <ins>replaced</ins> with something else, this is how you do it. The inserted text will automatically be underlined.</p>

    <p>This is how you do <sub>subscript</sub> text. This is how you do <sup>superscript</sup> text.</p>

    <p>Do you want to highlight something? Do it like <mark>this!</mark></p>
